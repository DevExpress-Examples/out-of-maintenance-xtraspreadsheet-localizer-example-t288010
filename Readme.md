# XtraSpreadsheet localizer example


This example shows how the <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraSpreadsheetLocalizationXtraSpreadsheetLocalizertopic">XtraSpreadsheetLocalizer</a> class helps to determine visual elements and captions where the resources specified by the DevExpress.XtraSpreadsheet.Localization.XtraSpreadsheetStringId enumeration are used. Default captions are substituted with the names of the corresponding enumeration members, so that they can be easily identified.
